## Prompt

```bash
sgpt --model=gpt-4 --chat git-stats "example bash script to crawl current directory and output a csv file. the columns should be file extension, number of files, and lines of code per file extension. exclude the git directory" | tee -a "$filepath"
```

## Response

Here is a simple bash script that will crawl the current directory, excluding the .git directory, and output a CSV file with the columns: file extension, number of files, and lines of code per file extension.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Create a temporary file
temp_file=$(mktemp)

# Crawl the current directory excluding .git directory
find . -type f -not -path './.git/*' | while read -r file
do
    # Get the file extension
    extension="${file##*.}"
    # Count the lines in the file
    lines=$(wc -l < "$file")
    # Output the extension and lines to the temporary file
    echo "$extension,$lines" >> "$temp_file"
done

# Process the temporary file to get the final counts
awk -F, '{ext[$1]++; lines[$1]+=$2} END{for (i in ext) print i, ext[i], lines[i]}' OFS=, "$temp_file" > output.csv

# Remove the temporary file
rm "$temp_file"
```

This script will create a file named `output.csv` in the current directory with the desired information. The script uses `find` to list all files in the current directory and its subdirectories, excluding the .git directory. It then uses `awk` to process this list, counting the number of files and lines of code for each file extension.
## Prompt

```bash
sgpt --model=gpt-4 --chat git-stats "great! could you also provide an exmaple script that aggregates the git commit history and outputs a csv file. the columns should be commit author, lines of code added, lines of code removed, number of commits, first commit date, and last commit date" | tee -a "$filepath"
```

## Response

Sure, here is a bash script that uses `git log` to gather commit history and output a CSV file with the columns: commit author, lines of code added, lines of code removed, number of commits, first commit date, and last commit date.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Create a temporary file
temp_file=$(mktemp)

# Get commit history from git
git log --pretty=format:'%an' --shortstat | awk 'BEGIN{print "Author,Added,Removed,Commits,First Commit,Last Commit"} \
    /./{if ($0 ~ /^[0-9]/) {added+=$4; removed+=$6; commits++} else {if (commits > 0) {print author","added","removed","commits","first_commit","last_commit}; author=$0; added=0; removed=0; commits=0; last_commit=first_commit; first_commit=strftime("%Y-%m-%d")}} \
    END{print author","added","removed","commits","first_commit","last_commit}' > "$temp_file"

# Move the temporary file to the final CSV file
mv "$temp_file" git_history.csv
```

This script will create a file named `git_history.csv` in the current directory with the desired information. The script uses `git log` to get the commit history, and then uses `awk` to process this information and output it in CSV format. The `awk` script keeps track of the number of lines added and removed, the number of commits, and the first and last commit dates for each author.
